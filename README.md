# NETWORKING-PROJECTS-1-MikroTik
My MikroTik ISP setup for 'OUR BANK LTD'. I’ve built a secure network using PPPoE for user login and PCQ to make sure everyone gets a fair, 10Mbps speed. It includes NAT for safe browsing and restricted single-user sessions to prevent account sharing. A practical approach to managing office bandwidth and security.
